1) the "zwave" folder should be coppied to the thingML directory containing the core thingML components. So it should like as follows:
./core/
./hardware/
./samples/
./studies/
./tests/
./zwave/

2) Generate C++ code for ./zwave/network.thingml
3) Go to a folder with generated code
4) Copy LinuxHomeCenterTest/open-zwave, LinuxHomeCenterTest/tiny-open-zwave-api to the folder with the generated code
4) Replace the contenets of the generated Makefile to the contents in LinuxHomeCenterTest/Makefile_VALID
5) Run make clean
6) make
7) sudo ./LinuxHomeCenterTest
